# 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Neutron TimeCube (NTC) analysis tools repository! This project is designed to provide researchers and data analysts with tools to interpret and visualize data from the NTC, a sophisticated device used in neutron detection and characterization.


## 📜 Description

The repository available at houses a suite of MATLAB scripts and functions tailored for the analysis of neutron detection data. With these tools, users can process, analyze, and visualize NTC data, facilitating cutting-edge research in neutron science.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before diving in, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

  ```bash
  
  ```
  Add the repository to the MATLAB path using:
  ```matlab
  >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab'))
  ```
- The following MATLAB toolboxes should be installed:
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  - Signal Processing Toolbox

Ensure that all installations and configurations match these requirements to smoothly run the NTC analysis tools.

## 🏃 Running the Tools

To begin analyzing your data:

1. Open MATLAB
2. Execute the command:
   ```matlab
   >> NTCviewer
   ```

Here is a glimpse of the kind of interface you can expect with our `NTCviewer`:
